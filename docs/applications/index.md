# Applications

This section contains advanced, real-world examples and applications of DeepMIMO that go beyond basic tutorials. These examples demonstrate complete end-to-end workflows for specific use cases.

## Available Applications

- **[Channel Prediction](1_channel_prediction.ipynb)**: Complete workflow for creating realistic channel sequences for ML-based channel prediction, covering interpolation techniques, Doppler effects, and comparative analysis.
- **[Sionna RT → DeepMIMO](2_sionna_rt_downstream.ipynb)**: Run Sionna RT 2.0 ray tracing on a built-in scene, export with `sionna_exporter`, convert with `dm.convert`, and load the resulting dataset. Requires `deepmimo[sionna]`.
- **[DeepMIMO → Sionna](3_sionna_upstream.ipynb)**: Load a DeepMIMO scenario, adapt channels to Sionna's `(a, tau)` format via `SionnaAdapter`, build an OFDM channel matrix, and compute spectral efficiency.
- **[OSM → Sionna RT → DeepMIMO](4_osm_pipeline.ipynb)**: Generate a Mitsuba scene from OpenStreetMap building data — no Blender required — run Sionna RT, and convert to DeepMIMO format.
- **[Dynamic Ray Tracing](5_dynamic_rt.ipynb)**: Run the ray tracer once per time snapshot to capture scenes where geometry itself changes (e.g. a moving transmitter or obstacle). Assembles snapshots into a `DynamicDataset`. For most mobility scenarios, [Tutorial 5](../tutorials/5_doppler_mobility.ipynb) is faster and sufficient.

## How Applications Differ from Tutorials

**Tutorials** focus on teaching specific DeepMIMO features and APIs in isolation.

**Applications** show complete end-to-end workflows for real use cases, often combining multiple features and demonstrating best practices for production scenarios.
