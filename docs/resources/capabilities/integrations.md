# Integrations Module Capabilities

This document details the capabilities of the DeepMIMO integrations module, which provides compatibility with external tools and platforms.

## Overview

The integrations module currently supports:
- **Sionna Adapter**: Convert DeepMIMO datasets to Sionna format for use with NVIDIA Sionna
- **Web Export**: Export datasets to binary format for the DeepMIMO web visualizer

## Usage Examples

### Sionna Adapter

```python
import deepmimo as dm
from deepmimo.integrations.sionna_adapter import SionnaAdapter

# Load dataset
dataset = dm.generate('O1_60')

# Create adapter
adapter = SionnaAdapter(dataset)

# Get batch of samples
for batch_idx in range(len(adapter)):
    channels, delays = adapter[batch_idx]
    # Use with Sionna neural network training
```

### Web Export

```python
import deepmimo as dm

# Load dataset
dataset = dm.generate('O1_60')

# Export for web visualizer
dm.export_dataset_to_binary(
    dataset,
    dataset_name='O1_60',
    output_dir='./web_datasets'
)
```

## Notes

- **[a]** DynamicDataset support requires selecting specific time snapshot before conversion.
- **[b]** Sionna adapter requires time-domain channels. Set `freq_domain=False` in `ch_params` when generating.
- **[c]** Angle information not exported to Sionna format as it's not used in standard Sionna workflows.
- **[d]** To export subset, trim dataset before passing to adapter: `dataset.trim(idxs=[...])`.
- **[e]** DynamicDataset can export individual snapshots: `dynamic_dataset[snapshot_idx]`.
- **[f]** Channel matrices and interaction positions omitted from web export due to file size constraints.

---

## Common Limitations

These limitations apply to both integrations:

- **Single frequency**: Both integrations work with single-frequency datasets only.
- **Memory constraints**: Large datasets may require subsetting before export.
- **Data precision**: Web export uses float32 by default for file size optimization.
- **Static snapshots**: Dynamic/time-varying datasets require manual snapshot selection.
