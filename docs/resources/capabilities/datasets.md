## Notes

- **[a]** MacroDataset and DynamicDataset delegate to underlying Dataset objects.
- **[b]** Custom antenna patterns supported via `AntennaPattern` class (isotropic, halfwave dipole, custom).
- **[c]** When `freq_domain=True` in channel parameters, supports OFDM subcarrier generation.
- **[d]** Interaction types: LoS (0), Reflection (1), Diffraction (2), Scattering (3), Transmission (5), combinations (e.g., 11=two reflections).
- **[e]** Supports rotation around TX or RX by specifying rotation axes (azimuth, elevation, roll).
- **[f]** Doppler computation requires velocity vectors to be set via `set_velocities()` method.
- **[g]** Trimming supports combined filters: indices, FoV (TX/RX), path depth, path types.
- **[h]** For MacroDataset/DynamicDataset, visualization operates on individual datasets (must specify which).
- **[i]** DynamicDataset export to Sionna requires time-step specification.
- **[j]** Internal storage uses MAT files; direct access via `_data` attribute or matrix keys.
- **[k]** Unit conversions: dBW ↔ Watts, degrees ↔ radians, spherical ↔ Cartesian coordinates.

## Common Limitations

These limitations apply to all dataset types:

- **Max paths**: Limited to `MAX_PATHS` (default 10) per TX-RX link for memory efficiency.
- **Path truncation**: Paths beyond `MAX_PATHS` are truncated during loading.
- **Antenna patterns**: Complex 3D patterns must be discretized into azimuth/elevation grids.
- **Memory usage**: Large multi-antenna MIMO channels can require significant memory.
- **Single frequency**: Channel generation is single-frequency per call (multi-band requires multiple generations).
