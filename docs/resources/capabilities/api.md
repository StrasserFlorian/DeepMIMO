# API Module Capabilities

This document details the capabilities of the DeepMIMO API module, which provides functionality for interacting with the DeepMIMO database including downloading scenarios, searching the database, and uploading new scenarios.

## Overview

The API module supports three main operations:
- **Download**: Retrieve scenarios and ray-tracing source files
- **Search**: Query the database for scenarios matching criteria  
- **Upload**: Submit new scenarios to the database

## Usage Examples

### Download

```python
import deepmimo as dm

# Download scenario
dm.download('O1_60')

# Download RT source
dm.download('O1_60', rt_source=True)

# Custom output directory
dm.download('O1_60', output_dir='./my_scenarios')
```

### Search

```python
import deepmimo as dm

# Search for mmWave scenarios
results = dm.search({
    'bands': ['mmW'],
    'environment': 'outdoor',
    'multiTxAnt': True
})

# Download search results
for scenario_name in results:
    dm.download(scenario_name)
```

### Upload

```python
import deepmimo as dm

# Upload scenario with API key
dm.upload(
    scenario_name='my_scenario',
    key='your_api_key',
    details='Custom urban scenario',
    include_images=True
)

# Upload RT source separately
dm.upload_rt_source(
    scenario_name='my_scenario',
    rt_source_path='/path/to/rt/files',
    key='your_api_key'
)
```

## Notes

- **[a]** No resume capability; interrupted downloads must restart. Consider external download manager for large files.
- **[b]** File integrity verified during extraction, but no pre-extraction checksum validation.
- **[c]** Batch downloads require looping; consider `search()` + loop for multiple scenarios.
- **[d]** Search returns scenario names that can be directly passed to `download()` or `load()`.
- **[e]** Submission-only mode useful when files already uploaded; updates metadata only.
- **[f]** Batch uploads not supported; use loop for multiple scenarios.

## API Endpoints

Internal endpoints (for reference):

| Endpoint | Purpose | Method |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/download/secure` | Get scenario download URL | GET |
| `/api/search/scenarios` | Search scenarios | POST |
| `/api/b2/authorize-upload` | Get upload authorization | GET |
| `/api/submit` | Create scenario submission | POST |

---

## Configuration

Default values (can be customized in source):

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `API_BASE_URL` | `https://deepmimo.net` | API server URL |
| `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` | 300 seconds | HTTP timeout |
| `FILE_SIZE_LIMIT` | 5 GB | Scenario size limit |
| `RT_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT` | 20 GB | RT source size limit |
| `IMAGE_SIZE_LIMIT` | 10 MB | Per-image size limit |
| `MAX_IMAGES_PER_UPLOAD` | 10 | Max images per submission |

---

## Common Limitations

These limitations apply across API operations:

- **Network dependency**: All operations require internet connection.
- **Single scenario**: Operations handle one scenario at a time.
- **No caching**: Search results not cached; queries sent to server each time.
- **Rate limiting**: Server may enforce rate limits (not currently documented).
- **File size limits**: Large scenarios/sources may exceed limits.
