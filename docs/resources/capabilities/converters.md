## Notes

- **[a]** Sionna supports multiple TX points or multi-antenna, but not both simultaneously in one run; same constraint for RX. Single TX and RX sets in metadata.
- **[b]** AODT aggregates all UEs into one RX set; Sionna uses one RX set; InSite supports multiple RX sets.
- **[c]** AODT validates patterns: isotropic required; warns on halfwave dipole, errors on non-isotropic/custom.
- **[e]** Sionna does not support transmissions; AODT and InSite map transmission-like events.
- **[f]** AODT picks a time index for paths and RX positions from routes; Sionna exports one time slice of amplitudes; InSite runs are static per export but converter supports multi-scene foldering.
- **[g]** Inactive RXs: Sionna counts zero-amplitude paths; InSite uses 250 dB path-loss sentinel; AODT does not update active counts.
- **[h]** AODT scene reader exists (USD-like) but is disabled in the main converter flow; Sionna and InSite export scenes.
- **[i]** AODT computes permittivity/conductivity via ITU-R P.2040; Sionna maps RT scattering patterns; InSite includes EM, roughness/thickness, and foliage attenuation.
- **[j]** GPS bbox: Sionna includes when min/max lat/lon provided; InSite computes from study area + origin; AODT sets (0,0,0,0).
- **[k]** Sionna detects sources==targets and exports BS–BS paths.
- **[l]** InSite infers element count from polarization (Vertical/Horizontal=1, Both=2) but doesn't export per-element geometry.
- **[n]** InSite interaction positions parsed from .p2m; Sionna from vertices; AODT from interaction point lists.
- **[o]** Terrain flags: AODT reflection/scattering true, diffraction false; Sionna per-RT flags; InSite per setup.
- **[p]** Copy sources: AODT (.parquet), Sionna (.pkl), InSite (.setup/.txrx/.city/.ter/.veg/.kmz).
- **[q]** Dual-pol: AODT via panel flag; Sionna via num_ant vs size; InSite via "Both" polarization.
- **[r]** AODT computes angles from geometry; Sionna provides angles; InSite from file fields.
- **[s]** Note: AODT doesn't have scene geometry export enabled.
- **[t]** Sionna sorts by path amplitude before truncation to MAX_PATHS.

## Common Limitations

The following limitations apply to **all converters** (not specific to any ray tracer):

### Antenna Patterns
All converters currently support only **isotropic antenna patterns**. This is a converter limitation, not a ray-tracer limitation. The ray tracers themselves support various antenna patterns, but the converters don't yet import this information.

### Path Truncation
All converters limit paths to `MAX_PATHS` (default: 10) per TX-RX link for memory efficiency. Additional paths beyond this limit are discarded.

### Single Frequency
All converters handle single-frequency simulations. Multi-band scenarios require separate conversions per frequency band.

### Position Precision
All converters store positions in float32 precision for memory efficiency, which provides ~7 decimal digits of precision.

## Important Distinctions

### Converter Limitations vs Ray-Tracer Limitations

Some features marked with ✗ are **ray-tracer limitations** (the ray-tracing software itself doesn't support the feature), while others are **converter limitations** (the converter doesn't import that information yet, even though the ray tracer supports it).

For detailed information about the ray tracers themselves, see [Comparing Ray Tracers](../comparing_raytracers.md).
