# Wireless Data Generation Pipeline

DeepMIMO sits at the center of a three-phase workflow for generating large-scale,
ray-tracing-derived wireless datasets.  The diagram below shows the full pipeline;
this page walks through each phase and step in detail.

## Phase 1 — Scene Generation

Phase 1 produces a 3D geometric scene that a ray tracer can consume.  The inputs
are real-world geographic data (GIS sources, OpenStreetMap, satellite imagery);
the outputs are ray-tracer-specific scene files.

### Step 1 — Scene Extraction

Fetch raw geometry from a GIS source.  DeepMIMO's OSM pipeline queries
[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) via the Overpass API and returns
building footprints, road networks, and terrain within a GPS bounding box.

```python
from deepmimo.pipelines.blender_osm import fetch_osm_scene

fetch_osm_scene(
    minlat=40.752, minlon=-73.982,
    maxlat=40.756, maxlon=-73.977,
    output_folder="./times_square",
    output_formats=["insite", "sionna"],
)
```

Other GIS sources (LiDAR point clouds, urban digital twins, CAD files) can be
used directly with the export step.

### Step 2 — Scene Processing

Raw GIS data is often noisy or multi-source.  This step merges, cleans, and
normalizes the geometry:

- Trimming roads and buildings to the simulation bounding box
- Extruding 2D footprints into 3D building meshes
- Assigning material properties (concrete, glass, asphalt, …) to each surface
- Converting coordinates from GPS to Cartesian, storing the GPS origin for
  later reference

DeepMIMO's Blender pipeline handles this automatically when called with
`fetch_osm_scene`.  For custom scenes, any mesh-editing tool (Blender, Open3D,
CGAL) can be used.

### Step 3 — Scene Export

The processed scene is written to the native format of each target ray tracer.

| Ray Tracer | Format | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| **NVIDIA AODT** | OpenUSD (`.usd` / `.usdc`) | Standard USD scene graph |
| **Sionna RT** | Mitsuba XML (`.xml` + meshes) | Each surface as a Mitsuba shape |
| **Remcom Wireless InSite** | PLY buildings + `.city` / `.ter` files | InSite-specific ASCII/binary formats |

The same bounding box and material assignments are written to all three formats
simultaneously, ensuring that every ray tracer simulates the same physical environment.

## Phase 2 — Channel Emulation

Phase 2 is DeepMIMO's core responsibility.  It drives one or more ray tracers over
a large number of TX/RX configurations and converts the outputs into a unified
dataset format.

### Step 4 — Configure Ray Tracer

This is the most complex step because every ray tracer exposes a different
configuration API.  DeepMIMO solves this in two complementary ways:

**Option A — Ray-tracer-native configuration**  
Pass parameters directly to the target tracer (Sionna `PathSolver` kwargs,
InSite `.setup` XML fields, AODT config).  Gives full control but requires
knowing each tracer's API.

**Option B — DeepMIMO unified parameters**  
Define simulation parameters once using DeepMIMO's `RTParams` object.  DeepMIMO
maps these to each tracer using a *best-effort* translation that preserves
physical equivalence as closely as the tracer allows:

```python
rt_params = {
    "carrier_freq": 28e9,          # Hz
    "max_reflections": 5,
    "max_diffractions": 1,
    "max_scattering": 0,
    "max_transmissions": 2,        # InSite / AODT only
    "num_rays": 1_000_000,
    "synthetic_array": True,
}
```

| Parameter | AODT | Sionna RT | Wireless InSite |
|-----------|------|-----------|-----------------|
| Carrier frequency | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Reflections | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Diffractions | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Transmissions | ✓ | ✗ (not supported) | ✓ |
| Diffuse scattering | ✓ | ✓ (final interaction only) | ✓ |
| Number of rays | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Synthetic array | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

### Step 5 — Run Ray Tracer

DeepMIMO wraps each ray tracer with a thin pipeline layer that handles:

- **Identical inputs** — the same TX/RX positions and scene are fed to every tracer
- **Batch processing** — large RX grids are split into batches to fit GPU/RAM budgets
- **Progress tracking** — `tqdm` bars show per-batch and per-TX-index progress
- **Output collection** — paths are saved to disk in a tracer-agnostic intermediate format

```python
# Sionna RT
from deepmimo.pipelines.sionna_rt import raytrace_sionna

raytrace_sionna(
    scene_path="./times_square/sionna_scene.xml",
    tx_pos=[[0, 0, 25]],
    rx_pos=rx_grid,
    save_folder="./rt_output/sionna",
    **rt_params,
)

# Wireless InSite
from deepmimo.pipelines.wireless_insite import raytrace_insite

raytrace_insite(
    osm_folder="./times_square",
    tx_pos=[[0, 0, 25]],
    rx_pos=rx_grid,
    save_folder="./rt_output/insite",
    wi_exe="/opt/insite/calcprop_server",
    wi_lic="/opt/insite/license.lic",
    **rt_params,
)
```

Automation difficulty varies by tracer:

| Tracer | Automation maturity |
|--------|-------------------|
| Sionna RT | Fully automated — pure Python API |
| NVIDIA AODT | Automated via USD + Python SDK |
| Remcom Wireless InSite | Automated via XML config + CLI launcher; requires InSite licence |

### Step 6 — Convert Outputs

Raw ray-tracer outputs are parsed and converted into DeepMIMO's unified scenario
format (a set of `.mat` files per TX–RX pair, plus a `params.json`).

```python
from deepmimo.converters import convert

convert("./rt_output/sionna", output_folder="./deepmimo_scenarios/times_square")
```

The converter normalizes path attributes (power, delay, angles, interaction types)
across all three tracers so that downstream processing is tracer-agnostic.
See [Converters](capabilities/converters.md) for format details.

### Step 7 — Compute Channels

The converted ray-tracing data is loaded as a `Dataset` and channels are computed
for any antenna configuration and frequency plan:

```python
import deepmimo as dm
from deepmimo.generator import ChannelParameters

ds = dm.load("times_square")
ch_params = ChannelParameters(
    bs_antenna={"shape": [8, 8]},
    ue_antenna={"shape": [1, 1]},
    ofdm={"num_subcarriers": 512, "bandwidth": 100e6},
)
ds.compute_channels(ch_params)
# ds["channel"] → [n_ue, M_rx, M_tx, K_subcarriers]
```

### Step 8 — Export Channels

Computed channels are exported to whichever downstream format is required:

```python
# Sionna upstream — feed channels back into Sionna PHY layer
from deepmimo.exporters import sionna_exporter
sionna_exporter(ds, output_folder="./sionna_input")

# AODT upstream
from deepmimo.exporters import aodt_exporter
aodt_exporter(ds, output_folder="./aodt_input")

# Raw numpy / pickle for custom use
ds.to_binary("./channels.pkl")
```

---

## Phase 3 — Downstream Simulation

Phase 3 consumes the exported channels in an application-level simulator.

### Step 9 — Run Simulation

The exported channel data drives the simulation block of interest.  Examples:

- **5G NR link-level**: compute BLER curves with realistic OFDM channels
- **Beamforming**: evaluate beam codebooks under spatially correlated channels
- **Channel estimation**: benchmark pilots, interpolation, and DNN estimators
- **AI/ML training**: feed channel sequences to prediction or classification models

DeepMIMO ships integration adapters for [Sionna](../api/integrations.md) (PHY
layer) so channels can be fed directly into Sionna's OFDM pipeline without manual
reshaping.

### Step 10 — Collect & Store Data

Simulation outputs (BLERs, capacity, prediction errors, …) are saved for analysis
and, optionally, fed back into the DeepMIMO database to build a reproducible
public dataset.
